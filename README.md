This is a simple HTML only website, which was an assignment in a web development course by Andrei Neagoi that I am taking. Btw the course is awesome, you should go check it out ! It is called Zero To Mastery: The Complete Web Developer in 2018.    

You can find it over here: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-in-2018/


    
So yeah, I got creative and included some humor in the website. XD
If you have been following the news, you know about the false nuclear missle alert that happened in Hawaii recently. This website represents the pannel that was used to initiate the false alert. :)

    
Enjoy! XD
